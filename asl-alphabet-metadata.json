Thanks!** \uD83D\uDE03 \n\n### About\n\nThe data set is a collection of images of alphabets from the American Sign Language, separated in 29 folders which represent the various classes.\n\n### Content\n\nThe training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for *SPACE*, *DELETE* and *NOTHING*.\nThese 3 classes are very helpful in real-time applications, and classification.\nThe test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real-world test images.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\nhttps://www.nidcd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Content%20Images/NIDCD-ASL-hands-2014.jpg\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nPLEASE CITE THE DATASET AS:\n\n @misc{https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/aslalphabet_akash nagaraj_2018,\n\ttitle={ASL Alphabet},\n\turl={https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/29550},\n\tDOI={10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/29550},\n\n  [1]: https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Content%20Images/NIDCD-ASL-hands-2014.jpg"}
