Thank you for following my jorney on ASL training models, I hope this project grow to help hear impare americans all over the country.
The alphabet dataset in which I train my model belongs to Akash Nagaraj, and can be found at:
Akash Nagaraj(2018). ASL Alphabet [Data set]. Kaggle. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/29550. 
I also upload the data on the reposotory, but, to use, please give the proper credict to the original creater.
